# Overview
  * Joining data tables can give meaningful insights, but there are some pitfalls that we need to be mindful of. Here are types of joins:
      1. *Cross join*: combines each row of the first dataset with each row of the second dataset, where every combination is represented in the output
      2. *Inner join*
      3. *Left join*
      4. *Right join*
